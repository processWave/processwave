# processWave.org Editor
The processWave.org editor is a collaborative diagram editor for Google Wave. It allows multiple people to edit the same diagram at the same time. Currently, six diagram types are support: UML, BPMN, simpleBPMN, FMC, petri nets and EPC. Due to the open source nature of the project this list of supported stencil sets can easily be extended using the project's plug-in architecture. The processWave.org editor is based on the [ORYX project](http://code.google.com/p/oryx-editor/) and it was developed as a bachelor's project at the [Hasso-Plattner-Institute Potsdam, Germany](http://hpi.de/en.html).
